# RhythmRecall_Project
This project is part of INT371 Experiential Learning Project I (1/2023) and INT372 Experiential Learning Project II (2/2023) which is the one I am currently studying in this semester. This project is different from the Integrated Project since Capstone Project will need everyone to create their own project. Therefore, we have come up with a project called “RhythmRecall”. It is a web application that allows people to share their photos or videos inside the concert. Furthermore, each media can be separated into each zone of the concert. The technology stack of this project that we use is the familiar one from our last internship. Therefore, we use SQL Server for our database. Note that this is release 1. There will be more until release 4 as that is the last release of RhythmRecall Project.
